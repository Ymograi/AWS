**Redis** is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. 
It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.[Click here to learn more](https://redis.io/commands)
